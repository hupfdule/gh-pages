Style guide for projects written in Go
=====================================

Variables
---------

Do not use the short declaration of multiple variables of the same type,
but instead define the type for each variable explicitly.

Therefore don't write

[source,go]
----
x, y int
----

but instead

[source,go]
----
x int
y int
----

Go modules
----------

Always use go modules. Adhere to the conventions for go modules.

Go projects should be written in a way the they may be compiled with a go
version that does not support go modules (<1.11).

If there really is a reason to not use go modules, that reason must be
documented.
